# SML - PROJECT

## Instructions

Perform a rigourous and reproducible comparative study of at least 3 learning approaches on the chosen task.
The learning approaches should be evaluated. The study should explain the choice of representations, as well as parameters of the learning approaches. You should provide a short analysis and discussion of the results. We expect conclusions on the pros and cons (learning quality, required amount of data or computing resources, ...) of each learning approaches on the chosen task.
 
## Deliverable

1. Jupyter notebook presenting and enabling to reproduce experiments (notebook file or link to it + pdf export);
2. Short report in pdf format;
3. 15mn presentation with slides.

*The report and presentation should contain the presentation of the task, the methodology, the experiments and the results (under the form of a table), the short analysis and conclusions, in a synthetic, precise and clear manner.*
